# Stock_Price_Movement_Prediction
A deep learning model to predict stock price movements using LSTM neural networks. This project uses historical stock data to predict whether a stock price will go up or down on the next trading day.
Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict stock price movements using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model analyzes historical stock data and extracts features from technical indicators to make predictions about future price movements.
Key Features:
1. Automatic Data Acquisition: Downloads historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API
2. Technical Indicator Generation: Calculates multiple technical indicators including RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands
3. LSTM Neural Network: Implements a deep learning model optimized for time-series prediction
4. Comprehensive Visualization: Includes tools to visualize stock data, model performance, and prediction results
5. Flexible Parameter Tuning: Easily customize model parameters and prediction timeframes
